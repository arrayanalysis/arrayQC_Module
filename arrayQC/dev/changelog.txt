## v1.2.4:
# 13-11-2012 Stan:
# - Renamed normalized objects to MA[[<normalization method>]].
# - Adjusted many functions (read: removed excess repetition of code)
# - softwarepackage variable renamed to dataformat
# - run_arraQC_2.R created, development version of last adjustments.
# -- Made use of lists for storing normalized data objects
#    RG
#    - Raw$R/G      Red / Green foreground
#    - Raw$RBg/GBg  Red / Green background
#    - Summary
## v1.2.3:
# 08-08-2012 Stan:
# - Minor bugfix in makeLimmaCompatible (replaced RG$source with x$source)
# 26-07-2012 Stan:
# - Various:
#    -- Removed image.orientation variable, since it is no longer needed for the image3by2Adp() function
#    -- Renamed 'descriptionFile' variable and functions to 'columnHeaderFile' and updated the 'run_arrayQC.R' script.
#    -- Updated how QualityControl() is triggered. For 'agilent' and 'genepix' format this function will run normally, 
#       for 'generic' the user is asked to run this function by hand.
#    -- Added warning in arrayQC.R that if a memory allocation error occurs, users should increase their memory with
#       memory.limit()
# - ReadFiles()  
#    -- Added functionality that checks if the column names that the user provided in the columHeader file are present 
#       in the first 100 lines. If a column name does not exist, it will pass an additional check to see if the column 
#       is a required column for arrayQC. If not required, the script will go on. If required, the script will halt.
#       (--> .checkColumns() )
#    -- Created .NAcheck() to check for full NA rows in a data object. This fixed an existing issue with the 'generic' 
#       format where non-existing data was also checked (and resulted in an error).
# - checkColumns()
#    -- updated from 25-04-2012
#    -- stored in requiredColumns.R (new script)
#    -- will check a file (requiredColumns.arrayQC) if a value is present or not. If the value is present, then it's 
#       a required column for arrayQC to work.
#    -- This should only be checked for 'fes' and 'genepix' values. For 'generic' formats only the foreground and background
#       signals are necessary.
# - CreateSummaryPlots()
#    -- Now checks if both RG$summary and RG$datatype are present before it proceeds.
#    -- Altered the way how mean, median, min and max rows were removed from the data object. More flexible now to additions.
#    -- Checks now if a QC field is present in the summary field, if not, no image of that particular QC field will be
#       generated.
#       
## v1.2.2
# 11-05-2012 Stan: - fixed issue with image3by2Adp dimensions. 
#                    Also adjusted settings for images where [height] > 3*[width]
# 25-04-2012 Stan: - imageplot3by2Adp: 
#                  -- dimensions of the output image are now calculated based on the 
#                     dimensions of the data object. This information is retrieved from the RG$printer layout!
#                     [[WARNING]] NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS IF IT REALLY WORKS, ESPECIALLY BLOCKED ARRAYS!
#                  -- Screen displays used 'name' to inform which plot has been generated.
#                  - Implemented progress bars for the following functions:
#                  -- imageplot3by2Adp
#                  -- CreateMAplots
#                  - Added requiredColumns.arrayQC and requiredColumns.R
##
## v1.2.1
# 11-04-2012 Stan: - Bugfix in makeLimmaCompatible. If no rows are missing, object will be returned unaltered.
# 14-12-2011 Stan: - Bugfixes related to 'generic' format (descriptionFile NULL handling)
#                  -- ReadFiles incorrectly selected the rows for highest matches (imagene format).
#                     increased maxLines to read from 50 to 100.
#
# 01-12-2011 Stan: - Some additional bugfixes in ReadFiles regarding block handling.
# 30-11-2011 Stan: - minor bugfixes for .readFiles() and generateDescriptionFile(). 
#                  - Implemented the "Block" parameter into default arrayQC description files.
#                  - Added global variables 'number.of.blocks', 'nblock.row' and 'nblock.col' for block support.
#                  - If Blocks-column is missing from RG, it will be added now.
# 28-11-2011 Stan: arrayQC now obtains information about array column headers from a file (previously: scripted in).
#                  For "fes" and "genepix" these files are generated on the fly and interpreted. For "generic"
#                  a file is created and the user can fill this in. 
#                  spot for 'default' packages. For generic microarrays, an empty file is created and must
#                  be filled in by the user.
# 28-11-2011 Stan: Added global variable "image.orientation"
#                  - Has an effect in the orientation of imageplots (pre-implementation)
##
# 28-07-2011 Stan: Fixed issue in ReadFiles where blocks were defined as either 48 (4x12) or none. Switch-
#                  function now also checks for 36 blocks (3x12).
#                  Added miRNA-specific script. Main difference for FES: no description column, currently
#                  this column is identical to the GeneName annotation field!
# 25-01-2011 Stan: Fixed minor bug in ReadFiles (column name checks). ReadLines() sometimes adds
#                  a \"<entry>\", which didn't allow us to find exact column name matches. This
#                  \" will now be removed prior to applying the check (ReadFiles.R)
# 21-12-2010 Stan: Adjusted column name checking. By default, the first 50 lines of the first
#                  file in the description file will be read and screened for a maximum number
#                  overlapping column names. If this number is incorrect, then an error will
#                  be generated displaying the missing/non-matching column names.
#                  Also, a full list of usable column names is provided, so the user can check
#                  this.
# 13-12-2010 Stan: "generic" format now uses a description file which the user has to fill in 
#                  before arrayQC can continue. If this file is NOT present, then it will be 
#                  automatically generated. If the file IS present, it will be parsed for the 
#                  minimum required columns. Still need to finalize the required column checks.
#                  [ReadFiles.R / run_arrayQC.R]
#                  Temporary question: Do we need to adjust each function, so it checks which
#                  columns are available. IF columns are missing, that specific QC will not be
#                  executed? Is this worthwile to invest time in?
# 13-12-2010 Stan: Prepared description file usage for "genepix" and "fes" format. At the 
#                  current time this is not (yet) implemented [ReadFiles.R / run_arrayQC.R]
# 13-12-2010 Stan: Created 2 new dataformat files: "description_fes_format.arrayQC" and 
#                  "description_genepix_format.arrayQC", both located in the arrayQC/dataformat 
#                  directory. WHen this system goes live, it is then required to have one of
#                  these files in your data directory before arrayQC can proceed (i.e. through 
#                  a download). The assumption is that when arrayQC is used, either a full 
#                  local copy (i.e. through SVN) or an internet connection is available.
# 13-12-2010 Stan: Limma made changes in read.maimages in the usage of the channels parameter. 
#                  In the newer releases this has been changed to 'green.only'. At the current 
#                  time, the script will look up the version of R and act accordingly, although
#                  it would be a better idea when this was done on the limma version.                
# 09-11-2010 Lars: Adapted ReadFiles to correctly verify whether all column headers given, do exist in the data files [ReadFiles.R]

#                  [ReadFiles.R]
# 11-10-2010 Stan: Added colorbars to imageplots. (Alpha phase) [CreateQCPlots.R]
#                  Adjusted scripts to search and load the 'shape' library [CreateQCPlots.R / install_arrayQC_packages.R]
#                  Modified run_arrayQC.R in preparation for the "generic" addition:
#                  - Argument checks are in place
#                  - Variable content changes based on the values of these arguments
# 29-09-2010 Lars: Added CreatePCAplot function
# 16-09-2010 Stan: Fixed bug in CreateDensities() which crashed the automated script when
#                  plotting only one array in the image. [CreateQCPlots.R]
#                  Adjusted line width in DensityPlots to better distinguish the lighter
#                  colors; legend now no longer shows blocks, but the appropriate lines.
#                  [CreateQCPlots.R]
# 19-08-2010 Stan: SaveData: removed usage of quotes in write.table (quote=FALSE) [QC.R]

# 22-07-2010 Stan: Ensured that run_arrayQC.R was run from the SVN server
# 20-07-2010 Stan: Updated checks of "description" file. If default file "description.txt" is not present, 
#                  the user has a possibility to type in the correct filename. If this file is not present, 
#                  then arrayQC fails to start up. Future plans are to implement this in the ReadFiles 
#                  function [run_arrayQC.R]

# 24-08-2009                          - renamed methods2 and method2, so users can choose their own distance and clustering algorithms.
# 21-08-2009 Lars: Createsummary: restructured function and adapted to work with one-color data
# 21-08-2009 Lars: CreateSummary: corrected computation of number of control to also work for GenePix data
# 21-08-2009 Lars: fixed small error in CreateWeights function to correctly take into account manualFlags
# 21-08-2009 Lars: adapted MakeLimmaCompatible function to only run when data is FES data
# 18-08-2009 Stan: added softwarepackage-parameter ("fes"/"genepix") to start initiate output-specific variables/images.
# 18-08-2009 Stan: fixed everything in such a way that this script is now compatible with Agilent FES output! Note to developers: ONLY SAVE GLOBAL CHANGES IN THIS FILE! 
# 18-08-2009 Stan: workdir will now be automatically created if it does not exist (v1.07)
# 11-08-2009 Lars: adapted QualityControl and QCFields to work with one color data (note: CreateWeights has to be checked/adapted still
# 11-08-2009 Lars: adapted checks in ReadFiles for later QC checks possible to work with one color data and check NumPix
# 11-08-2009 Lars: added check on targets file in ReadFiles
# 10-08-2009 Lars: adapted MakeLimmaCompatible to work with one color data
# 10-08-2009 Lars: adapted MakeLimmaCompatible to check which columns are really there
# 10-08-2009 Lars: adapted ReadFiles to be able to read and process one color data
# 10-08-2009 Lars: ReadFiles adapated to check for presence of channels (correctness and one or two colour)
# 16-07-2009 Maarten: Various adaptations to make GenePix supported (see accompanying Word docx for details)
# 15-07-2009 ReadFiles and QualityControl now check for the presence of the columns IsWellAboveBG and IsSaturated. If not, these
#            features are calculated so that Quality Control can run normally.
#            (in case of WellAboveBG, columns containing pixel-standard deviation need to be present, else the function stops)
# 15-07-2009 Maarten: added 'source' argument to ReadFiles, which is passed to read.maimages
# 14-07-2009 Maarten: Contents of annotation-list (fields that are in RG$genes) is now tested in ReadFiles. FeatureNum, Row, Col  
#            and ControlType are obligatory, the other fields are not necessary, since these are only pasted to the output table
#            at the end of the modelling. 
# 14-07-2009 Maarten: Edited ReadFiles, Quality Control and CreateSummary to make sure that they check if certain fields are 
#            present in the RG-object, before performing calculation steps or plotting, which caused these functions to crash
#            if the fields were not loaded during ReadFiles.
#            CreateSummary Plots makes only images for fields that are present in Summary
# 14-07-2009 Maarten: BoxplotPNG now plots 2-logged R and G values if RGList is provided.
# 13-07-2009 Maarten: Improved ImagePlot3by2Adp function. Logratio-array is now made using MA.RAW.W$M object.
#            Error in red-coloring of all arrays at IsWellAboveBG-category. Now, the sum of all spots which are above BG is taken instead of the minimum and maximum.
# 13-07-2009 Maarten: Adapted BoxplotPNG function. RGList provided to the function does now also work (ylim was out of range) 
#            also turned x-axis labels 90 degrees and determined bottom-margins automatically
# 13-07-2009 Maarten: Adapted PlotDensities function. If FES was FALSE, the legend was placed over the background plot.
#            Changed mfrow to c(2,2), so that the legend is plotted in the 4th quadrant 
# 13-07-2009 Maarten: In HierArchCluster function, it is now not longer needed to provide $M in the first argument, since the function now 
#            looks for this column automatically.
# 10-07-2009 Maarten: Added HeatMap function
# 10-07-2009 Maarten: adaptations to CreateMAPlots function: function tests class of objects that were provided and outputs a decent
#            error message if needed, it counts number of objects that have a wrong class and cannot be plotted (the correct class ones
#            will be plotted), mfrows are automatically adapted to the number of plots that remain after checking of classes, 
#            When more than 4 normalization objects are provided to the function, it gives a decent error message and stops 
# 08-07-2009 Maarten renamed rSaturated column in other.columns to rIsSaturated, because QualityControl looks for this name
# 08-07-2009 Maarten added a line in ReadFiles, so that names of other.columns are set to the default values, as the script expects
# 07-07-2009 Maarten inserted tabs and spaces, so that the layout is consistent
#            Adapted CreateSummaryPlots to plot number of spots that have been flagged per criterion
#            Adapted CreateSummaryPlots and PlotDensities to leave part_1, part_2 etc out of filename when there is only 1 part
#            Adapted writeExpOutput function. logFC is NOT always the 10th column. Now, the number is looked up with a which() statement             
# 06-07-2009 Maarten adapted MAPlots function. The density coloring is included and it's not necessary to provide EXACTLY 
#            4 normalization methods. mfrow is now set according to the number of normalization methods. 
# 02-07-2009 Maarten adapted Imageplot3by2Adp function. Now, titles of outlying arrays are colored red
# 01-07-2009 (Stan) imageplot3by2Adp | removed RG-parameter, now this function can be used for all forms of data (i.e single-channel data)
# 01-07-2009 Lars adapted the CalculateSummary function to include specific QC statistics
# 30-06-2009 Lars adapted QC function, uses fields instead of matrix now
# 29-06-2009 Maarten removed comments, since this is in the documentation SOP file. Comments that are not described in the SOP are
#            still present in this script
# 23-06-2009 (Stan) HierarchClustering | Added new parameters for output (output.type, width, height) and choose whether or not the generated cluster-object is returned (return.value) 
#            (Stan) BoxplotPNG | Fixed minor bugs when using GenePix data; simplified some object names.
# 23-06-2009 Stan fixed some minor errors in titles naming.
# 17-06-2009 Maarten added CreateSummaryPlots function, which visualizes the information from the Summary Object.
# 15-06-2009 Maarten removed makeLimmaCompatible from ReadFiles function and placed it in the main script. This because updated 
#            annotation information (see main script) has to be loaded before the makeLimmaCompatible step (because of the dimensions)
# 11-06-2009 Maarten corrected the wrong arguments in the boxplotPNG function. All plots were default on zero.weight=FALSE, even the filtered spots :S
# 11-06-2009 Maarten adapted the names of all functions (removed dots (.) from names)
# 11-06-2009 Maarten added the Hierarchcluster function
# 11-06-2009 Maarten changed CreateMAplots. Dotsize of the plots was too big. Now, the text with the axes is readable and the dots are smaller.
# 09-06-2009 Lars changed function to build weights minorly to improve speed
# 08-06-2009 Maarten revised CreateDensityPlots, considering the arrays per page... First, the last array of a set was not 
#            plotted for some amounts of arrays.
#            Maarten changed PlotDensities --> The ranges of X and Y axes are now automatically calculated from the maximum values
#            and the k and k.max positions are passed by the position-argument in the PlotDensities function.
# 08-06-2009 Lars changed functions to build QC matrix and weights to be faster and fixed error in mean/median criterion
# 08-06-2009 Lars moved adding spottypes to the readfiles function
# 07-06-2009 Lars adapted CreateWeights function to work with any number of checks (not just 4) and much faster
# 07-06-2009 Lars adapted QC Matrix function to check for proper input and give feedback on options chosen
# 07-06-2009 Lars adapted ReadFiles function to als set Rb/Gb.Real of controls to NA if present
# 07-06-2009 Lars adapted MakeLimmaCompatible function to detect which $other fields are present
# 07-06-2009 Lars adapted the ReadFiles and MakeLimmaCompatible function to detect if weights and Rb/Gb.Real
#			       are present instead of passing parameters weights and Real.BG from ReadFiles to MakeLimmaCompatible
# 05-06-2009 (Stan) General - changed png image dimensions to: width=1600, height=1200, pointsize=20 for high-quality images
#            (Stan) Moved required libraries to top of file
#            (Stan) ImagePlot3by.own - Fixed minor bug (missing RG)
#            (Stan) ImagePlot3by.own - Added logscale-option (i.e. log-scaling foreground and background signal, less color discrepancy)
#            (Stan) ImagePlot3by.own - Increased width factor from 6.5 to 8.5 to improve artifact visualisation
#            (Stan) PlotDensities - Changed log10 to log2, matching other functions using the log2 scale
#            (Stan) PlotDensities - Added FES-parameter (default: FALSE) for FES-specific analysis; adjusted code for this
#            (Stan) PlotDensities - Cleaned up code; Changed text: "Mean intensity" -> "Foreground Intensity" (this can also be a median value!)
#            (Stan) CreateDensityPlots - Added small line to show function progress to user.
#            (Stan) naZeroWeights - Simplified used variables, removed excessive code.
#            (Stan) boxplot.png - Changed default value of Zero.Weight-parameter to FALSE.
#            (Stan) boxplot.overview - Changed default value of Zero.Weight-parameter to FALSE.
# 05-06-2009 Maarten renamed data-objects with Agilent in the name to something more general.
# 03-06-2009 Maarten created Create.Density.Plots function, which is a modification of the original function (see comment 18-05-2009). Now, the number of plots is equally distributed over the pages.
# 29-05-2009 Maarten changed Quality.Control function; normalization criteria can now be chosen
#            Maarten changed CreateWeights function. It is now the same function for both type of weights, with other arguments.
#            Maarten changed imageplot3by2.own function (changed arguments)
# 27-05-2009 Maarten added the possibility to virtually recreate the arrays by plotting them back with the imageplot3by2.own function
# 26-05-2009 Maarten placed the reading of the spottypes up in the script. It is now just after ReadFiles
#            Maarten placed printer layout within the ReadFiles function
#            Maarten changed the reference parameter in Agilent.design to "Control"  | changed targets into Agilent.RG$targets
#            Maarten changed the location of some non-standard objects (like weights.norm, weights.HQ) to Agilent.RG$other$...
# 18-05-2009 Maarten changed the number of DensityPlots in 1 figure to 10. We still need to change this part of code, so that 
#            different files will be equally filled with plots.
# 15-05-2009 Maarten added the possibility to plot all types of normalized data (within and between), if necessary
# 14-05-2009 Maarten made some modifications in resolution/margins of the PlotDensities function (now it works)
# 13-05-2009 Maarten placed the MA Plots in a new function, called Create.MA.Plots, which can be found in the CreateQCPlots.R file
# 12-05-2009 Maarten and Lars improved the makeLimmaCompatible function
# earlier    Maarten categorized and grouped functions that are linked into separate .R-files

# Susan changed the paths on 28-01-2009
# Susan changes the criteria from (-3,-3,-3,-8) to (-3,-3,-8,-8)
